## Learning the military alphabet
A small project I developed for myself.

This program would take a word, say "alphabet", and then ask the user to input the military alphabet word for each letter. A user can also input their custom word.

I wanted to learn the words for the military alphabet, as it is a skill one may need suddenly when talking verbally. Looking online, I found a lot of images that shows the correspondance between each letter and word, but didn't find that sufficient.

Not yet published on a public repository, will be released later once I put more features in and improve usability.

Work in progress...
